Exercice 2b.
I implemented the algorithm from exercise e2b. Testing for cart-pole gave a positive result. The robot completed the task. For training, I used ten epochs, and each time by the end of the tenth epoch, the robot reached a result. Reducing the number of eras and evaluation episodes reduces the quality of learning. This algorithm with the same parameters did not solve the problem of the pendulum. I think that the reason is that the pendulum problem consists of two tasks, swing-up and stabilization in the vicinity of equilibrium. Cart-pole in this case is only stabilization in the vicinity of equilibrium
